        FOIA bureaucracy still mired with problems with repeated calls for change, data, experts indicate
      </h1>

      Lead inspection reports. Software contracts. Body camera video. Those are just some of the records Chicagoans have requested from the city government using Illinois’ Freedom of Information Act — FOIA for short. 

      Chicago receives thousands of FOIA requests a year, and the government is supposed to “operate openly and provide public records as expediently and efficiently as possible,” at least according to the law itself. 

      But some Chicago FOIA logs suggest otherwise, and many experts say that public record requests aren’t working as well as they should, whether at the local, state or federal level. 

      “This statement applies to all levels of government: the current administration is violating the law on a daily basis when it comes to FOIA,” said attorney Merrick Wayne, who focuses on FOIA litigation at the Chicago firm Loevy & Loevy. “The prior administration was breaking the law on a near-daily basis when it applied to FOIA … I expect the next administrations will continue to violate FOIA.” 

      In Chicago, elected officials have frequently found ways to circumvent public records rules, Wayne said. Former Mayor Rahm Emmanuel, who held office from 2011-2019, would communicate about public business from personal devices, making it harder to view those policy conversations through FOIA. 

      And while former Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration was more stringent about using government issued devices, Wayne said current Mayor Brandon Johnson takes after Emmanuel. 

      “We’re seeing a lot of these requests to the Mayor’s office for text messages and for these communication records,” he said. “They are just not being responded to.” 

      Many of Chicago’s FOIA requests don’t go to the Mayor’s office. Instead, each of Chicago’s more than 30 city departments has its own FOIA office. Some, like the Business Affairs and Consumer Protection Department, had one officer process all 705 of its requests in 2024. Others, like the police department, have larger operations.

      </div>

      FOIA logs obtained from the public health, procurement, finance and business affairs departments show that while these departments generally processed FOIA requests within their statutory deadline, full document disclosure is seldom the outcome. 

      The frequency of partial requests isn’t surprising, Wayne said, because there’s often a lot of private or otherwise exempt information in requested documents. 

      Those exemptions can shift from year to year as legislators in Springfield seek changes to FOIA. In the last few Illinois General Assembly Sessions, lawmakers have filed more bills to amend the statute. Most don’t pass.

      “Even FOIA’s proponents down in Springfield … have concerns that fixing even one small provision in FOIA to make it more requester friendly can open up the entire law to potential amendments and changes from the legislators,” Wayne said. 

      And of the ones that do become state law, many are small additions to a section of the law that already exempts records prohibited from release by other state laws, Wayne added. 

      Still, FOIA has undergone some overhauls in the last two decades. A change in 2010 gave the state Public Access Counselor (PAC) — then a relatively new office — more powers to enforce FOIA’s requirement for government agencies. Those included the ability to accept requests for review from the public and filing lawsuits on behalf of requesters. 

      From 2010, FOIA appeals to the PAC soared to more than 4,300 in Fiscal Year 2015, which started in July 2014. That was more than triple the number of cases the PAC received in FY 2009.

      Despite the growing interest in changing FOIA in the last two general assemblies, Wayne says Illinois’ political leadership hasn’t been interested in reforms. Across levels of government, elected officials only pay lip service to FOIA, he said. 

      “I think there’s a lot of faux transparency too in the federal government, especially with this administration,” Wayne said. “Some examples of that — obviously you have bipartisan for FOIA and transparency, but no one actually does anything.” 

      An April Congressional hearing on FOIA featured some of the more political discourse that often surrounds the federal statute’s use and administration. Of three witnesses invited, two worked for conservative activist groups. One, Mike Howell, spent most of his testimony talking about how his organization’s FOIA cases “animated some of the most controversial scandals of the Biden Administration.” 

      The Executive Branch has also heavily changed the federal FOIA landscape since President Donald Trump took office a second time in January. In the last few months, high-ranking government officials have slashed FOIA offices, even though the most recently available data shows request volume continues to increase.

      Wayne contrasted Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s public statements about “radical transparency” with entire FOIA offices being eliminated at the department as another example of “faux transparency.” 

      What politicians say about FOIA and how they actually treat it are continuously in tension, Wayne said. Each legislator, elected official and bureaucrat has to choose to uphold or disregard the law, he added. 

      “There are people who work in the government who … get a request, they see a document and they say: ‘What can I withhold from this? What can I prevent them from seeing?’”, Wayne said. “That philosophy, I think, is very key. You don’t want a FOIA officer who is ready — who has the cap off their black Sharpie ready to go.”
