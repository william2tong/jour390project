    FOIA bureaucracy still full of problems with repeated calls for change, data and experts indicate

  <div class="maincolumn">
    Lead inspection reports. Software contracts. Body camera video. Those are just some of the records Chicagoans have
    requested from the city government using Illinois’ Freedom of Information Act — FOIA for short. <br />
    <br />
    Chicago receives thousands of FOIA requests a year, and the government is supposed to “operate openly and provide
    public records as expediently and efficiently as possible,” at least according to the law itself. <br />
    <br />
    But some Chicago FOIA logs suggest otherwise, and many experts say that public record requests aren’t working as
    well as they should, whether at the local, state or federal level. <br />
    <br />
    “This statement applies to all levels of government: the current administration is violating the law on a daily
    basis when it comes to FOIA,” said attorney Merrick Wayne, who focuses on FOIA litigation at the Chicago firm Loevy
    & Loevy. “The prior administration was breaking the law on a near-daily basis when it applied to FOIA … I expect the
    next administrations will continue to violate FOIA.” <br />
    <br />
    In Chicago, elected officials have frequently found ways to circumvent public records rules, Wayne said. Former
    Mayor Rahm Emmanuel, who held office from 2011-2019, would communicate about public business from personal devices,
    making it harder to view those policy conversations through FOIA. <br />
    <br />
    And while former Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration was more stringent about using government issued devices,
    Wayne said current Mayor Brandon Johnson takes after Emmanuel. <br />
    <br />
    “We’re seeing a lot of these requests to the Mayor’s office for text messages and for these communication records,”
    he said. “They are just not being responded to.” <br />
    <br />
    Many of Chicago’s FOIA requests don’t go to the Mayor’s office. Instead, each of Chicago’s more than 30 city
    departments has its own FOIA office. Some, like the Business Affairs and Consumer Protection Department, had one
    officer process all 705 of its requests in 2024. Others, like the police department, have larger operations. <br />

    <br />
    FOIA logs obtained from the public health, procurement, finance and business affairs departments show that while
    these departments generally processed FOIA requests within their statutory deadline, full document disclosure is
    seldom the outcome. <br />
    <br />
    The frequency of partial requests isn’t surprising, Wayne said, because there’s often a lot of private or otherwise
    exempt information in requested documents. <br />
    <br />
    Those exemptions can shift from year to year as legislators in Springfield seek changes to FOIA. In the last few
    Illinois General Assembly Sessions, lawmakers have filed more bills to amend the statute. Most don’t pass. <br />
    <br />

    “Even FOIA’s proponents down in Springfield … have concerns that fixing even one small provision in FOIA to make it
    more requester friendly can open up the entire law to potential amendments and changes from the legislators,” Wayne
    said. <br />
    <br />
    And of the ones that do become state law, many are small additions to a section of the law that already exempts
    records prohibited from release by other state laws, Wayne added. <br />
    <br />
    Still, FOIA has undergone some overhauls in the last two decades. A change in 2010 gave the state Public Access
    Counselor (PAC) — then a relatively new office — more powers to enforce FOIA’s requirement for government agencies.
    Those included the ability to accept requests for review from the public and filing lawsuits on behalf of
    requesters. <br />
    <br />
    From 2010, FOIA appeals to the PAC soared to more than 4,300 in Fiscal Year 2015, which started in July 2014. That
    was more than triple the number of cases the PAC received in FY 2009. <br />

    Despite the growing interest in changing FOIA in the last two general assemblies, Wayne says Illinois’ political
    leadership hasn’t been interested in reforms. Across levels of government, elected officials only pay lip service to
    FOIA, he said. <br />
    <br />
    “I think there’s a lot of faux transparency too in the federal government, especially with this administration,”
    Wayne said. “Some examples of that — obviously you have bipartisan for FOIA and transparency, but no one actually
    does anything.” <br />
    <br />
    An April Congressional hearing on FOIA featured some of the more political discourse that often surrounds the
    federal statute’s use and administration. Of three witnesses invited, two worked for conservative activist groups.
    One, Mike Howell, spent most of his testimony talking about how his organization’s FOIA cases “animated some of the
    most controversial scandals of the Biden Administration.” <br />
    <br />
    The Executive Branch has also heavily changed the federal FOIA landscape since President Donald Trump took office a
    second time in January. In the last few months, high-ranking government officials have slashed FOIA offices, even
    though the most recently available data shows request volume continues to increase. <br />

    Wayne contrasted Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s public statements about “radical
    transparency” with entire FOIA offices being eliminated at the department as another example of “faux transparency.”
    <br />
    <br />
    What politicians say about FOIA and how they actually treat it are continuously in tension, Wayne said. Each
    legislator, elected official and bureaucrat has to choose to uphold or disregard the law, he added. <br />
    <br />
    “There are people who work in the government who … get a request, they see a document and they say: ‘What can I
    withhold from this? What can I prevent them from seeing?’”, Wayne said. “That philosophy, I think, is very key. You
    don’t want a FOIA officer who is ready — who has the cap off their black Sharpie ready to go.” <br />

    <h4><u><b>Methodology</b></u></h4>
    <br />
    Data for this project came from four categories: Chicago FOIA logs, Illinois General Assembly (ILGA) Bill Status
    reports, Illinois Attorney General Public Access Counselor (PAC) annual reports and the federal FOIA application
    programming interface (API).
    <br /><br />
    To obtain Chicago FOIA logs, I submitted FOIA requests to the included agencies. Based on responsive requests, I
    cleaned out any extraneous dates’ data, calculated completion time by subtracting the completed date and creation
    date in Google Sheets and creating pivot tables for request statuses for each agency, which goes into each agency’s
    “Types of Dispositions” chart. Using basic Python Pandas library functions, I also show the number of requests in
    each dataset, mean completion time and most common request status.
    <br /><br />
    For ILGA FOIA bill data, I scraped and downloaded each legislative session’s Status of Legislation document from
    <a href="https://ilga.gov/PreviousGA.asp" target="_blank">https://ilga.gov/PreviousGA.asp</a>. Then, I searched each
    for the FOIA tag and manually entered the data into a
    spreadsheet.
    <br /><br />
    For PAC case data, I scraped and downloaded each year’s PAC Annual Report from
    <a href="https://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/Open-And-Honest-Government/PAC/Annual-Reports/"
      target="_blank">https://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/Open-And-Honest-Government/PAC/Annual-Reports/</a>. I manually
    counted case
    statistics from each year and entered them manually into a Google Sheet.
    <br /><br />
    For federal FOIA data, I downloaded JSON files of all available agency annual reports. Note that on multiple tries,
    I could not access API pages containing DOD annual reports, and that data is not reflected in the individual agency
    tab of the federal FOIA dashboard.
