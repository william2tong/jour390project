My client has owned, and continues to own, the subject property, but the previous property management company was not paying the water bills in full each month (and instead diverting the excess funds for its own uses). We have finally started reconciling the water bills in an effort to understand how the account balance accumulated so substantially, and it is apparent that there were a second water meters at this property because the bank statements we finally obtained from the property manager (who we sued for mismanagement) indicate that two separate invoices were being paid to the Water Department each month. I managed to obtain a relatively recent water bill from the current property manager, and a copy is attached. As you will find, the property which my client identifies as 352-62 East 60th Street receives separate water bills corresponding to the following addresses: 5950-58 S King Drive and 5957-59 S Calumet. The documents you produced in response to the FOIA request relate to 5950-58 S King, but there is a second set of bills we would like as well, specifically those issued to 5957-59 S Calumet. Is it possible to provide the water ledgers and payment histories for these too? Or do I need to submit a new FOIA request?
