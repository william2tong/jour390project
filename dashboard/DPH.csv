Dear FOIA Officer,

In accordance with the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (5 ILCS 140), I am requesting access to the following public records:

- The final Chicago Department of Public Health departmental budget request for the fiscal year 2025 budget cycle as submitted to the Office of Budget and Management. 

These records are requested in the digital format in which they were submitted to or by the originating city department, including Excel-compatible formats (.xslx, .csv, etc.) where applicable.

This request is made on behalf of the Better Government Organization, a non-profit media and policy analysis organization doing work in the public interest, and is not made for commercial purposes as defined in 5 ILCS 140/2(c-10). A fee waiver is requested.

In the unlikely event that you claim any portion of the above public records to be exempt from disclosure under 5 ILCS 140, in writing please (i) identify which portion or portions you claim are exempt and the statutory provision or provisions you contend apply; (ii) set forth the reasons for your conclusion that such portion or portions are exempt; and (iii) release the remainder of such records for inspection and copying, redacting only the portion or portions you claim are exempt.

Please note that the statute does not allow your agency to withhold documents in their entirety if only parts of the records may be exempt.

Please provide the information within five business days, as required by law. For your convenience it is noted here that Friday, 27 December 2024 will be the fifth business day from the submission of this request, taking into account the city’s official holiday on Christmas Day.

ALL PM10 MONITOR DATA FROM CHICAGO RAIL AND PORT, LLC (“CRP”) FROM APRIL 1, 2019 UNTIL JUNE 30, 2024. “PM10 MONITOR DATA” MEANS ALL RAW AND PROCESSED CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENTS TAKEN FROM ALL FIVE PM10 MONITORS ON THE CRP PROPERTY, TERMED “SOUTHEAST”, “NORTHEAST”, “NORTHWEST”, “SOUTHWEST”, AND “CENTRAL-EAST.” MONITOR DATA INCLUDES ALL MEASUREMENTS MADE FOR EACH MONITOR IN 15-MINUTE INCREMENTS, IN UNITS OF MICROGRAMS PER CUBIC METER. PM10 MONITOR DATA ARE PRESUMABLY MAINTAINED BY CDPH IN ONE OR MORE ELECTRONIC SPREADSHEET FILES (I.E. IN THE .CSV, .XLS, or .XLSX FORMATS). 

If a responsive document contains both exempt and non-exempt information, please redact the exempted information and provide those portions of the document that are not exempted from disclosure. If you deny any part of this request or withhold any responsive documents, please provide the reason or reasons for such denial in writing, including citation to the applicable exemption and a detailed factual basis for the application of that exemption, as required by 5 ILCS 140/9. If you determine that any of the records described above do not exist, please affirmatively indicate that no such record exists. If you determine that any of the records described above are already publicly available, please indicate where I may find them. Illinois law requires that you respond to this request within five business days. 5 ILCS 140/3(d). I ask that you disclose the requested records as they become available, rather than waiting until all of the records have been assembled. NRDC requests a waiver of any fee that would otherwise be charged for the search, review, and production of responsive records. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/6(c), documents shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge when the requestor states the specific purpose of the request and indicates that a waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest. A waiver or reduction of fees is in the public interest here because the principal purpose of this request is to access and disseminate information regarding the health, safety and welfare of the general public. Specifically, this search concerns air quality data that are relevant to an open public comment period regarding a variance to CRP’s rock crushing facility permit. The purpose of this request is NOT to procure any personal or commercial benefit; this is not a commercial purpose request. NRDC is a non-profit environmental organization and advocates on behalf of thousands of members in Illinois. Please note that NRDC is also not a recurrent requester under 5 ILCS 140/2(g), as NRDC is a non-profit and the principal purpose of this request is to access and disseminate information concerning a current event as a form of public education. If this fee waiver request is denied, please contact me prior to incurring any costs which may result in a fee. I request that all responsive documents be furnished as electronic copies, in the original file format by which they are maintained by the County whenever possible; responsive files possessed in a spreadsheet format (e.g. .xls, .xlsx, .csv extensions) should be furnished in that format rather than as a PDF file when possible. If the County only maintains non-electronic copies of a responsive document, I request that such document be scanned and provided as an electronic PDF file, rather than physically copied.

I request that a copy of the following documents [or documents containing the following information] be provided to me: records (including age, gender, race, ethnicity and zipcode the case was reported in) of all syphilis cases reported to the Chicago Department of Public Health from January 2000 - January 2024. I’d also love any data/responsive records related to the following questions. 

What was the number of syphilis cases reported by year in Chicago since January, 2000? 
What zipcodes in Chicago have seen the highest number of syphilis cases reported since January, 2000? 
What was the age, gender, race and/or ethnicity of the individual diagnosed with syphilis in each reported case since January, 2000? 
How many disease intervention specialists are currently employed in the city of Chicago?
How many of the cases assigned to disease intervention specialists have resulted in a successful contact with the patient? 

In order to help to determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am a Stanford Health Equity Media Fellow and former WBEZ reporter, working on a news story about congenital syphilis. This request is made as part of news gathering and not for commercial use.

I request a waiver of all fees for this request. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding and awareness of syphilis in Illinois.
I would like this information by Tuesday, February 13th.

Language changed to reflect our request for records that are not already publicly available.
 
These modifications should be sufficient to narrow your search and provide responsive records. In response to your letter’s explanation that the request is unduly
burdensome, the provided email addresses and search terms should sufficiently narrow the request so that you are able to produce the requested documents. The same names and search terms should also narrow the parts of the request which are not email-related
and render them non-burdensome.
 
In response to the portion of the letter that states that records produced to the Inspector General are exempt from FOIA, our request sought documents that may
be in CDPH possession related to the OIG report, which is public. While 5 ILCS 430 may limit your ability to provide the
OIG’s files and reports, the statute does not preclude your ability to produce to us CDPH documents existing prior to the OIG’s September 27, 2021 investigation. Regardless of whether they were provided to the OIG, they are not exempt from FOIA because
they existed prior to the investigation. Therefore, we are not “seeking the investigatory file of the Office of the Inspector General” by way of our request. We are also not seeking records created for the OIG for the purpose of their investigation. Rather,
we are seeking CDPH’s entire file with respect to Crawford site activities, and I have reworded the request accordingly.",3/26/2024 4:28:00 PM,41.35,41.00,Exemption Denial

To facilitate this request, I am seeking the following information:

Detailed breakdown of how the $23.8 million settlement funds will be allocated and or any plans as to how they could be allocated, including a comprehensive list of programs, projects, and initiatives that will be funded.

Information regarding the appointment of officials or individuals responsible for overseeing and implementing the initiatives funded by the JUUL settlement.

Documentation related to the financing and budgetary considerations for each program or initiative outlined in the allocation of the settlement funds.

Ways in which the programming will be measured for its efficacy

I am looking for additional information related to this facility located at 20257 S Western Ave, Chicago and the removal of a 1000-gal heating oil tank that occurred in July 2002, during City’s electric light work in S Western ROW (S Western & 103rd) . Other tanks were removed form this location and one permit may have an application for multiple tanks.

The attached information was pulled from City’s website, and I highlighted the tank in question and the associated permits and inspections. Can electronic copies be provided of the respective permits and/or applications. I am looking for a blueprint or map/figure with the location of this tank and the others that were present at the site.

Inspection: DOEINS3193; DOEINS171825
Facility ID#2022898
Permit Numbers: 106930 
Alternative address: 103rd & Western
 
The purpose is for upcoming environmental subsurface investigations related to this facility/site, and I request waiver of fees for this purpose.

Thank you,

Margot Amouyal,,1/15/2024 11:07:39 PM,1/30/2024 8:00:00 AM,"Dear FOIA Officer,

I hope this letter finds you well. Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), I am writing to request additional information regarding the recent press release announcing a $23.8 million settlement with JUUL Labs, as mentioned in the press release provided below.

Press Release: ""CHICAGO — The City of Chicago announced today that a $23.8M settlement has been reached with JUUL Labs, a leading e-cigarette maker, over claims that the company was engaged in harmful and deceptive business practices by marketing and selling vaping products to underage users.""

I am specifically interested in obtaining information about how the funds from this settlement are being utilized by the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) and the current status of initiatives aimed at preventing and reducing youth vaping in the city.

Additionally, I would like to request details on any programs, policies, or community engagement initiatives that have been implemented or are planned to be implemented using the settlement funds. This includes information on education efforts, local policies, parent and teacher supports, cessation programs, improvements in data collection, and community outreach initiatives.

I am also interested in, although I can understand if this information cannot be provided, the names of the people involved in allocating and using the JUUL settlement money (i.e., people involved in crafting the outreach campaigns, etc.).

I am also curious about how the city plans to track the usage of the funds to see if they are being effectively implemented. Will the city be tracking tobacco use rates among teens, for example, that did or did not undergo one of its health education classes? How will the health education being provided now be different from the one offered currently/before?

Furthermore, I am interested in any reports, studies, or evaluations conducted by the CDPH that assess the effectiveness and impact of these initiatives in combating youth vaping.

If there are any documents, reports, or records related to the above requests, I kindly request that they be provided to me in accordance with the FOIA guidelines. If any fees are associated with processing this request, please inform me in advance.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to receiving the requested information within the statutory timeframe.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Dear FOIA Officer,

I am writing to follow up on my previous FOIA request regarding the Chicago Department of Public Health's anti-vaping campaign following the nearly $24 million settlement with JUUL Labs. In response to my initial inquiry, you stated that the department has no documents responsive to my request at this time, citing that the campaign is still in its early planning and development stages.

While I appreciate the information provided, I seek further clarification on several key points regarding the campaign:

When does the Chicago Department of Public Health plan to commence work on the anti-vaping campaign?

Could you please provide details on the individuals or teams responsible for developing and implementing the campaign once the planning begins?

You said ""The anti-vaping campaign is still in its early planning and development stages."" What is the planning and development stage? How is that unfolding?

Where is the nearly $1 million currently? Is any of it being spent? Is it in a City savings account?

Are there any preliminary plans or proposals in place for the campaign, even if they are in draft form?

Has any work been initiated on the campaign thus far, and if so, are there any documents available for disclosure?

Furthermore, considering the proposed timeline for the campaign, which aims to focus on Chicago Public Schools' students starting spring semester 2024, I am particularly interested in understanding how the department plans to meet these deadlines, especially given the current absence of documents related to the campaign.

I kindly request that you provide any available information, updates, or documentation pertaining to the anti-vaping campaign, as this will greatly contribute to the accuracy and comprehensiveness of my reporting.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your prompt response.

Please advise on what should we do. 

We are very sorry. 
Won’t ever do this again. 

Much love,
